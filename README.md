# Gezure-Server

Gezure is an android app that lets users use their Myo Gesture Control Armband to control the app [to switch between categories, video and even between devices] using appropriate gestures.
Gezure was among the top 5 apps (overall) in HackSC Fall 2014.

The Gezure-Server project was intended to run on a cloud server so that it can receive gesture messages from an Android device. It's main purpose was to send push notification to an intended device when the appropriate gesture was detected.
